## **Summary**

This report analyzes anti-authority sentiment between Anglophone and
Sinic countries. It finds that Sinic country Twitter users demonstrate
less positive sentiment when using a collection of anti-authority words.
This may be due to the differing influence of Confucian verses European
enlightenment values.

The rest of the report is organized into the following sections:

1.  Authoritarian Tendencies
2.  Twitter: Sentiment Analysis

 

## **1: Authoritarian Tendencies**

1.1: Power distance scores according to Hofstede’s seminal cultural
dimension’s study. Power distance is the extent to which people accept
unequal power in society *(Hofstede, 1980)*.

## **2: Twitter: Sentiment Analysis**

The analysis collects tweets containing anti-authority words within a 50
mile range of Anglophone and Sinic country capitals. The data are
collected from 11-05-2021 until present.

A sentiment analysis is conducted using the NRC sentiment library. This
is done by calculating how often words associated with certain
sentiments occur relative to their respective regional totals. Figures
2.1 and 2.2 show selected emotions while figures 2.3 to 2.5 show the net
sentiment (positive minus negative words).
