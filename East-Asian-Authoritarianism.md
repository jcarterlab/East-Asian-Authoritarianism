## **Summary**

This report compares Authoritarianism between Sinc and Anglophone
countries. It finds that Sinic country Twitter users demonstrate less
positive sentiment when using freedom and a collection of anti-authority
related words. This may be due to the differing influence of Confucian
and European enlightenment values in shaping attitudes towards
individual liberty.

It could also however be the result of a difference in situational
context. Many people in Hong Kong and Taiwan for instance likely tweet
negatively about their own freedoms given China’s growing regional
assertiveness. South East Asian countries may also be more likely to
tweet negatively about the tragic loss of freedom Myanmar following a
recent military coup.

The rest of the report is organized into the following sections:

1.  The Current Situation
2.  Twitter: Sentiment Analysis

## **2. Twitter: Sentiment Analysis**

The analysis collects tweets from within a 50 mile range of the
respective country capitals each week beginning on 10/04/2021. A
sentiment analysis is then conducted using the NRC lexicon library. This
is done by calculating how often words associated with certain
sentiments occur compared to their respective regional totals.
