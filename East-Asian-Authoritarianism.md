## **Summary**

This report analyzes anti-authority sentiment between Anglophone and
Sinic countries. In a collection of tweets containing at least one of
nine anti-authority words, it finds consistently less positive sentiment
for Sinic country Twitter users. This may be due in part to the
differing influence of Confucian verses European enlightenment values in
defining attitudes towards individual liberty.

The rest of the report is organized into the following sections:

1)  Authoritarian Tendencies
2)  Sentiment Analysis

 

## **1: Authoritarian Tendencies**

1.1: Power distance scores of Hofstede’s seminal cultural dimension’s
study. Power distance is the extent to which people accept unequal power
in society *(Hofstede, 1980)*.

## **2: Sentiment Analysis**

The tweets are collected within a 50 mile range of Anglophone and Sinic
country capitals from 11-05-2021 to present. A sentiment analysis is
then conducted using the NRC sentiment library.

The Anglophone countries consist of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and South Africa. The Sinic countries consist of China,
Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.

The anti-authority words include 1) defy, 2) disobey, 3) dissent, 4)
oppose, 5) protest, 6) rebel, 7) resist, 8) revolt and 9) riot.

Figures 2.1 to 2.3 show net sentiment (positive minus negative words),
while figures 2.4 to 2.5 show specific emotions.
