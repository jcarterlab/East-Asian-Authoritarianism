## **Summary**

This report analyzes anti-authority sentiment between Anglophone and
Sinic countries. It finds that Sinic country Twitter users demonstrate
less positive sentiment in a collection of tweets containing nine anti-authority words.
This may in part be due to the differing influence of Confucian verses European
enlightenment values in defining attitudes towards individual liberty. 

The rest of the report is organized into the following sections:

1.  Authoritarian Tendencies
2.  Sentiment Analysis

 

## **1: Authoritarian Tendencies**

1.1: Power distance scores according to Hofstede’s seminal cultural
dimension’s study. Power distance is the extent to which people accept
unequal power in society *(Hofstede, 1980)*.

## **2: Sentiment Analysis**

The tweets are collected within a 50
mile range of Anglophone and Sinic country capitals from 11-05-2021 to
present. A sentiment analysis is then conducted using the NRC sentiment
library. Figures 2.1
and 2.2 show specific emotions while figures 2.3 to 2.5 show net
sentiment (positive minus negative words).

The anti-authority words includes 1) defy, 2) disobey, 3) dissent, 4) oppose,
5) protest, 6) rebel, 7) resist, 8) revolt and 9) riot.
